# tvOS Tips and Tricks Example Repository

This repository serves as an example companion to my blog post on *tvOS tips and tricks*.

In the associated blog post, I delve into the *most important differences* I've identified between iOS and tvOS during the development of a tvOS application. A central focus of tvOS development, which I consider particularly important, is the management of focus using *UIFocusGuide*.

Additionally, the blog post covers the following sections:

## Sections:

- *tvOS Frameworks*: Explore the frameworks specifically tailored for tvOS development.

- *Key Differences Between iOS and tvOS App Development*: Understand the *significant divergences* between developing for iOS and tvOS.

- *tvOS Restrictions*: Delve into the *restrictions and considerations* unique to the tvOS platform.

Feel free to explore the code in this repository as a practical demonstration of the concepts discussed in the blog post.
